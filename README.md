# hello-world
First repository
ASSESMENT DETAILS:
Your first task is to create a WYSIWIG editor (like Microsoft word or Google doc) using html, css and javascript. Don’t use any backend. If you absolutely have to, then use simple json files…

Minimum Functionality:  basic styling, highlight, color, bold, italic and font size.
Optional Features: hyperlinks, indentations, adding images, adding code.
Advanced Optional Features: an option to save the document,  an option for multiple people to interact together on one doc.

The code should be open source, so create a Github account and send me the links for your projects. (learn about github workflow if you don’t understand it)

I will be looking at the commit history so make sure you commit regularly instead of committing the complete project on the last day.
 
DEADLINES: You have 2 weeks to complete the project, starting tomorrow, so the deadline for submissions is June 20th. I will pull the changes on the night of 20th 12:00am and try to run them locally. If there is any other info needed then assume stuff and put it inside a readme file in the project.
 
I will judge the work on usability and documentation. You can look on the internet all you want but make sure you mention the source.
